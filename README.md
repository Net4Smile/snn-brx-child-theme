## Features

### Loop Dynamic Data Tags





### Site Dynamic Data Tags

This tags are used usualy outside of the custom loops.

### {current_author_id}**

This is used in the author.php archive page. I added this tag for using in the conditions.
With this we can create  advanced current author loops or current author related profile editing page.
Without current author id check we can not create profile editing for current author so we need this tag.


### {post_count:post_type_name}
### {post_count:post_type_name:taxonomy_name:term_slug}

With this tag we can get post count for specific post types or specific post types with taxonomies.
